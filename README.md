# PKToolbox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pk/pktoolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pk/pktoolbox)

Current failure is due to the fact that travis-ci doesn't support iOS8 and XCode 6
and Specta is only working reliably with XCode 6 in its WIP branch which is only
for XCode 6 & iOS8.
